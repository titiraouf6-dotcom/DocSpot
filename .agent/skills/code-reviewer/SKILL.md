# Code Reviewer Skill

This skill provides expert-level code review capabilities, focusing on maintainability, security, and adherence to coding standards. It includes checklists and automated tools to analyze pull requests and code quality.

## Core Expertise

### 1. Code Quality Analysis
- **Standard Checks**: Verify adherence to coding standards and style guides.
- **Anti-patterns**: Identify common mistakes and sub-optimal solutions.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure code is easy to read, test, and extend.

### 2. Automated Tools
- **PR Analyzer**: Analyze changes in pull requests (`scripts/pr_analyzer.py`).
- **Quality Checker**: Automated code quality checks (`scripts/code_quality_checker.py`).
- **Review Reports**: Generate detailed review reports (`scripts/review_report_generator.py`).

## Reference Documentation
Detailed guides are available in the `references/` directory:

- [Coding Standards](file:///Users/ruy/Code/mySkills/.agent/skills/code-reviewer/references/coding_standards.md): Language-specific best practices.
- [Common Anti-patterns](file:///Users/ruy/Code/mySkills/.agent/skills/code-reviewer/references/common_antipatterns.md): What to avoid during development.

## Interaction Patterns

### When to Invoke
- Before merging a Pull Request.
- During code refactoring to ensure quality.
- When establishing or enforcing new coding standards.

### Review Strategy
1. **Understand Purpose**: What is the code trying to achieve?
2. **Structural Review**: Is the architecture sound and follow patterns?
3. **Detail Review**: Logic errors, security flaws, and edge cases.
4. **Summary**: Provide actionable feedback and improvement suggestions.
